# aimi-panda

Code used for the panda challenge for the course Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging.

There are 4 folders:

- Experiments: Conducted experiments talked about in the report.
- EDA: To get a better idea of the data an exploratory data analysis was needed.
- starting_and_questions: Some code we used at the start with questions, unclarities, etc. were used to get a better idea of the challenge and the data.
- sandbox_and_pytorch: Contains some playground codework and also our pytorch implementetation (baseline uses fastai).
