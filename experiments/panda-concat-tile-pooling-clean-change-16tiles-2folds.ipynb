The task of this competition is classification of images with cancer tissue. The main challenge of this task is dealing with images of extremely high resolution and large areas of empty space. So, effective locating the areas of concern and zooming them in would be the key to reach high LB score.\n","\n","In this competition I found a number of public kernels performing straightforward rescaling the input images to square. However, for this particular data such an approach is not very efficient because the aspect ratio and size of provided images are not consistent and vary in a wide range. As a result, the input images are deformed to large extend in a not consistent manner uppon rescaling that limits the ability of the model to learn. Moreover, the input consists of large empty areas leading to inefficient use of GPU memory and GPU time.\n","\n","In this kernel I propose an alternative approach based on **Concatenate Tile pooling**. Instead of passing an entire image as an input, N tiles are selected from each image based on the number of tissue pixels (see [this kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/iafoss/panda-16x128x128-tiles) for description of data preparation and the [corresponding dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/iafoss/panda-16x128x128-tiles-data)) and passed independently through the convolutional part. The outputs of the convolutional part is concatenated in a large single map for each image preceding pooling and FC head (see image below). Since any spatial information is eliminated by the pooling layer, the Concat Tile pooling approach is nearly identical to passing an entire image through the convolutional part, excluding predictions for nearly empty regions, which do not contribute to the final prediction, and shuffle the remaining outputs into a square map of smaller size. Below I provide just a basic kernel only illustrating this approach. In my first trial I got 0.76 LB score, top 2 at the moment, and I believe it could be easily boosted to 0.80+. I hope you would enjoy my kernel, and please also check my submission kernel implementing the tile based approach.\n","\n","![](https://i.ibb.co/hF6LRVm/TILE.png)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-27T12:47:43.743484Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-27T12:47:43.743063Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-27T12:47:48.066695Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-27T12:47:48.066119Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-27T12:47:43.743437Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["'1.0.60'"]},"execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["%reload_ext
